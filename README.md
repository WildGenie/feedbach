========

A student response system written in AngularJS and NodeJS. The goal of this project is to create an easy way to create surveys for use in the class room. Everything is available as a HTML5 app, with no need to download or install software. Need to ask a question? Just do it! No need for login or student registration, just plain simple.


Why?
====

I'm a teacher student, and was not satisfied with the solutions available as of spring 2013. First, I was introduced to HiST Student Response System, which needs a program installed. It got some nice features, but why all that fancy stuff? Why not keep it simple? I like it simple.


Alternatives
============
* HiST Student Response System: http://www.histproject.no/node/263 - Requires to install software.
* Mentimeter: https://www.mentimeter.com/ - This one is nice. Clean, simple, but limited or expensive.
* Plickers: https://www.plickers.com/ - Totaly awesome, without need for student hardware.

My features
